# SmartSeal: IoT-Based Smart Anti-Tampering Solution

## 📦 Ensuring Package Integrity and Transparency from Warehouse to Doorstep

SmartSeal is an innovative IoT-powered solution designed to enhance the security of e-commerce deliveries by detecting tampering attempts in real-time. It continuously monitors package integrity and sends instant alerts to recipients or logistics providers upon detecting unauthorized access or unusual motion.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Tamper Detection:** Uses sensors to detect unauthorized openings.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Notifies users via cloud or mobile app.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Enables remote monitoring.
- **Secure Delivery Verification:** Ensures only authorized individuals can open the package.
- **Customizable:** Can be extended with GPS tracking or additional security features.

---

## 🔧 Hardware Components
- **ESP32/ESP8266:** The brain of the system, handling sensor inputs and cloud communication.
- **Magnetic Sensor:** Detects package openings by sensing changes in the magnetic field.
- **Motion Sensor:** Identifies sudden impacts or unauthorized movements.
- **Buzzer & LED Indicators:** Provides local alerts when tampering is detected.
- **Power Supply:** Battery-powered for portability.

---

## 📜 How It Works
### 1️⃣ Tamper Detection
- The **magnetic sensor** is placed at the package's opening edge.
- If the package is opened, the sensor detects the change.
- The **motion sensor** monitors for unusual movements or impacts.

### 2️⃣ Real-Time Alerts
- Upon tampering, the microcontroller triggers the **Wi-Fi module**.
- Sends real-time alerts to a **cloud-based dashboard** or **mobile app**.
- Optionally integrates with **GPS tracking** for location monitoring.

### 3️⃣ Secure Delivery Confirmation
- The recipient verifies their identity via an app-based **QR code** or **OTP system** before opening.
- If tampering is detected, the system logs it and alerts the concerned parties.
- If no issues are found, the recipient proceeds to open the package securely.
